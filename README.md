> **Easy Travel by Bus** is an urban mobility assistant that helps citizens navigate city buses effortlessly.  
> Built as a cross-platform solution (React Native mobile + React web, Django backend), it integrates **Neshan API** for mapping/traffic and uses a **multi-criteria routing engine** to recommend optimal bus paths with **minimum transfers, shortest travel time, and realistic ETAs**.

> **Note:** This repository is a **public case study**. The production source code is proprietary and cannot be published.  
> This README documents the architecture, algorithms, features, and my role in the project.

## ðŸ”Ž Quick Overview

- **Goal:** Make bus usage simple, fast, and reliable for everyday commuters.
- **My Role:** **Technical Manager** â€” system architecture, roadmap planning, integration strategy, quality oversight, and delivery.
- **Stack:**  
  - **Mobile:** React Native  
  - **Web:** React  
  - **Backend:** Django (REST)  
  - **Maps/Traffic/Geocoding:** **Neshan API**  
  - **Storage/Caching:** PostgreSQL + Redis (for geodata caching & rate-limit protection)
- **Collaboration:** Exploratory collaboration with **Tehran Municipality** (MVP reviews & alignment).
- **Status:** MVP completed and validated; production details remain private.

## ðŸ§  Routing Approach (Multi-Criteria A\*)

The routing engine models the transport network as a weighted directed graph:

- **Nodes:** bus stops (+ virtual nodes for origin/destination anchors)  
- **Edges:** 
  - **In-vehicle edges** (between consecutive stops on a line)  
  - **Transfer edges** (between stops within a walkable radius; includes **transfer penalty**)  
  - **Walking edges** (origin â†” nearest stop, stop â†” destination)

**Edge cost** combines:
- `in_vehicle_time` (from schedules/line speed)
- `waiting_time` (line frequency or inferred headway)
- `transfer_penalty` (discourages excessive transfers)
- `walk_time` for walking segments

A **multi-criteria A\*** variant is used:
- **Heuristic `h(n)`** â‰ˆ straight-line time to destination (Haversine + avg. speed)  
- **Cost `g(n)`** aggregates the components above  
- **Optimization objectives:** *minimize total time* with *low transfer count* as a secondary constraint

**ETA** is adjusted using **Neshan** traffic layers where available (fallback to historical averages otherwise).
